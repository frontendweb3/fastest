title: "Share"

Ghost includes a native share modal that lets readers share posts to social platforms without any custom UI or JavaScript in your theme.

## How it works

The share modal is triggered by linking to `#/share` on any URL. When a reader clicks a link that ends with `#/share`, Ghost opens a default modal with share options. Selecting a platform opens it with the current post's title and link pre-populated in a draft, ready to publish.

## Adding share to your theme

To expose the native share experience to readers, add a link to `#/share` anywhere in your theme:

```html
<a href="#/share">Share</a>
```

That's it — no additional JavaScript or UI needed. Ghost handles the modal and share options automatically. Place the link wherever makes sense in your theme: a post footer, a floating share bar, a menu, or inline within post content.

## Theme compatibility

Themes without a `#/share` link will continue to work as normal. All official Ghost themes already include a share link out of the box.
