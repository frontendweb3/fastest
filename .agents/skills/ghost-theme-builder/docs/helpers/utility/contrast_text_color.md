***

The `{{contrast_text_color}}` helper returns a high-contrast text color for a given background color.

Use it when your theme supports configurable brand or accent colors and you need readable text on top of them.

## Example Code

```handlebars
<button
    style="background: {{@site.accent_color}}; color: {{contrast_text_color @site.accent_color}};"
>
    Subscribe
</button>
```

For a dark background such as `#15171A`, the helper outputs:

```css
#FFFFFF
```

For a light background such as `#FFFFFF`, the helper outputs:

```css
#000000
```

## Notes

- Helps keep text readable on dynamic background colors
- Works well with `@site.accent_color`
- Falls back to `#FFFFFF` if the color is invalid or missing
