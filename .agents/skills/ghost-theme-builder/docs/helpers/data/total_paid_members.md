***

The total\_paid\_members helper outputs a rounded number of total paid members from your Ghost publication in a human readable format. Example:

```handlebars
{{total_paid_members}}
```

If you have 1225 paying members, it will output `1,200+`.

For values above 100,000 it will output `100k+` and `3m+` respectively.
