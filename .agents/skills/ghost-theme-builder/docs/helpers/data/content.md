`{{content}}` is a very simple helper used for outputting post content, when called within a `{{#post}}{{/post}}` [block expression](https://docs.ghost.org/themes/contexts/post#helpers). It makes sure that your HTML gets output correctly.

```
<!-- post.hbs -->

{{#post}}

<article class="{{post_class}}">
  <section class="post-content">
    {{content}}
  </section>
</article>

{{/post}}
```

You can limit the amount of HTML content to output by passing one of the options:

`{{content words="100"}}` will output just 100 words of HTML with correctly matched tags.

#### Default CTA

For visitors to members-enabled sites who don’t have access to the post in the current context, the `{{content}}` helper will output a [default upgrade/sign up CTA](/themes/members/#default-cta).
