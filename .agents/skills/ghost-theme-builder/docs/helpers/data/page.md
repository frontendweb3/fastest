* `@page.show_title_and_feature_image` - `true` (default) or `false` boolean toggle set on the page settings panel in the editor. 

This toggle lets editors hide a page’s title and feature image on a per-page basis, useful for pages that look radically different from posts (full-width headers, CTAs, landing pages). Gate any relevant markup in your page templates for the toggle to take effect.

## Example code

```handlebars
{{#match @page.show_title_and_feature_image}}
...content...
{{/match}}
```

## Styling tips when hiding the title and feature image

1. Whenever the page title and feature image are hidden, and the page content starts with a full-width card (such cards will have the class `.kg-width-full`), remove spacing between the top navigation and content (on pages only).
2. Whenever multiple full-width cards are stacked, remove spacing between them (on posts and pages).
3. Whenever content ends with a full-width card, remove spacing between the content and the footer (on pages only, posts often have additional content at the bottom such as comments, CTAs, related posts, etc.).

As a reminder, cards that have the ability to be set to full width are header cards, signup cards, image cards, and video cards. When an image or video has a caption, it will have the class `.kg-card-hascaption`, and maintaining spacing is desirable in this case.

The implementation of these changes will look different on every theme.
