## How to Contribution

The contribution is so easy in the fastest theme. You know about ghost installation and have basic knowledge about the ghost CMS, HTML, tailwind css, handlebars.js and gulp. All the configuration is already defined and you just run the npm script for it.

## steps

1. clone the theme locally with `git clone https://github.com/frontendweb3/fastest.git`
2. change the folder with `cd fastest` and run `pnpm install or npm install or yarn install`
3. change anything related to tailwind CSS. Make sure to run separate sever for tailwind css using `pnpm start or yarn start'.
4. change anything related to javascript then run `pnpm gulp or npm run gulp`. it will help to build or update the production-ready javascript file in the `assets/build/js` folder.
